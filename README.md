===============

Hey guys, this is Paul. When I see you all tonight I think we definitely need to discuss our project
and set some goals and expectations. I'm going to assume that we haven't gotten it started because
no one else has commited any code yet. I started a basic project to help get us started.

I want to talk to both of you in person tonight about this; as far as presentation goes, I believe we 
will need a WPF or some kind of visual representation for people to see. I think something we could do
would be to impelement this iteratively and recursively THEN we have our WPF gui timing the different
methods doing the same opperations. I think this will make our project very easy to do and would let us
split the whole thing into three parts that are fairly equal. But like I said, I'll touch base with every
one tonight. - PAUL
